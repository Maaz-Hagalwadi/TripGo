# 🚍 TripGo – Online Bus Booking Platform

TripGo is a **production-grade online bus booking system** built using **Java Spring Boot**, designed to showcase real-world backend engineering skills such as authentication, payments, transactional seat booking, and scalable architecture.

This project is structured to reflect **industry-level quality**, making it ideal for portfolios, interviews, and hands-on learning.
